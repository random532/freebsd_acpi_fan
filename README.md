#  FreeBSD acpi fan driver ("PNP0C0B")

Work in progress :- )
Due to my limited understanding of ACPICA, ACPI, and kernel subsystems, there will be bugs. Therefore, this can only useful for developers, not for end users, so far.

Todo: 
- polish it aka remove bugs
- actually try to compile
- fan performance states are not really finished yet
- 
Have a nice day :-)
